## Abstract

This TIP proposes a specification about how to handle signed data in TRON contracts.

## Motivation

Off-chain message signing for use on-chain now is widely used by some multisignature wallet implementations and tokens with `permit` method.

However, there is currently no standard for off-chain message signing for TRON protocol, so this TIP aims to introduce an signed data standard similar to [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191).

## Specification

We propose the following format for `signed_data`

```
0x19 <1 byte version> <version specific data> <data to sign>.
```

The format is totaly cmpatible with `EIP-191`.

Version `0` has `<20 byte address>` for the version specific data, and the `address` is the intended validator. In the case of a Multisig wallet, that is the walletâ€™s own address.

The initial `0x19` byte is intended to ensure that the `signed_data` is not valid beginning byte for `Transaction` and `Block`. Because in TRON protocol, the bytestrings transformed by the protobuf structure of `Transaction.raw` and `Block.Header` cannot start with `0x19`.

### Registry of version bytes

| Version byte | TIP            | Description
| ------------ | -------------- | -----------
|    `0x00`    | [191](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/442) | Data with intended validator
|    `0x01`    | [712](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/443) | Structured data

### Signatures and Hashing

A signature scheme consists of hashing algorithm and a signing algorithm. The signing algorithm of choice is `secp256k1`. The hashing algorithm of choice is `keccak256`.
