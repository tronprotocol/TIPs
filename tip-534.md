## Simple Summary
Propose to remove potential vulnerable APIs.


## Abstract
Previously some APIs could lead to the leakage of sensitive information, such as private keys.
Although developers have been advised not to make remote calls to these APIs, I think it is better to remove the relevant APIs for security concerns and mitigate risks for developers.


## Motivation
For network stability and user data security, I suggest deleting the relevant APIs.


## Specification

The following APIs should be removed.

### 1. HTTP
| API | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| createaddress | create address by password|
| generateaddress | create address randomly |
| easytransfer | transfer TRX with password |
| easytransferbyprivate | transfer TRX with private key |
| easytransferasset |  transfer asset with password |
| easytransferassetbyprivate | transfer asset with private key|
| gettransactionsign | sign transaction with private key |
| addtransactionsign | sign transaction with private key|


### 2. gGRPC
| API | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| CreateAddress | create address by password |
| GenerateAddress | create address randomly|
| EasyTransfer | transfer TRX with  password  |
| EasyTransferByPrivate |transfer TRX with  private key |
| EasyTransferAsset | transfer asset with  password|
| EasyTransferAssetByPrivate | transfer asset with private key |
| GetTransactionSign | sign transaction with private key |
| GetTransactionSign2 | sign transaction with private key |
| AddSign|sign transaction with private key|



## Rationale
Vulnerable APIs may lead to the leakage of sensitive information, such as private keys.

## Implementation

Delete the relevant APIs.
