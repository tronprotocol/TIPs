## Simple Summary

Move ABI out of SmartContract and store it in a new ABI store.

## Motivation

The ABI field is totally indeed when the TVM executing SmartContract. Moving out ABI can reduce execution time of some opcodes such as `EXTCODEHASH` `SLOAD` `SSTORE` `ISCONTRACT` `CREATE` and `CREATE2`.

## Specifications

#### ABI Store

Add a new store called ABI Store. The data stored in it is like below.

```
message ABI {
  message Entry {
    enum EntryType {
      UnknownEntryType = 0;
      Constructor = 1;
      Function = 2;
      Event = 3;
      Fallback = 4;
      Receive = 5;
    }
    message Param {
      bool indexed = 1;
      string name = 2;
      string type = 3;
    }
    enum StateMutabilityType {
      UnknownMutabilityType = 0;
      Pure = 1;
      View = 2;
      Nonpayable = 3;
      Payable = 4;
    }

    bool anonymous = 1;
    bool constant = 2;
    string name = 3;
    repeated Param inputs = 4;
    repeated Param outputs = 5;
    EntryType type = 6;
    bool payable = 7;
    StateMutabilityType stateMutability = 8;
  }
  repeated Entry entrys = 1;
}
```

## Rationale

#### Deploy Smart Contract

While committing contract cache, save ABI of the deployed contract to the ABI store, clear the ABI field of contract and save it to the Contract store.

#### Determine if constant

Get the ABI of contract in ABI store.

## Implementation

When tron clients start, traverse all contracts in store and save every contract`s ABI to the ABI store. While doing this operation, clear the ABI field of contract and update the contract to store.

```
class MoveAbiHelper
    def do_traverse_work() -> None:
        for contract in contract_store:
            if !abi_store.has(contract.address):
                abi_store.save(contract.getABI())
            contract.clear(field.ABI)
            contract_store.save(contract)
        assert contract_store.total() == abi_store.total()
```
