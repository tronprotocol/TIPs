## Simple Summary

MAX_FEE_LIMIT Should be Configurable.

## Abstract

Fixed `MAX_FEE_LIMIT` is not suitable as the cost of energy increases a lot recently. So we should make `MAX_FEE_LIMIT`  configurable in order to adjust dynamically.

## Motivation

As the cost of energy increased, in some cases, `MAX_FEE_LIMIT` may be insufficient. So we should change `MAX_FEE_LIMIT` to be a configurable parameter. If needed, we could make a proposal to update this parameter to a higher value.

## Specification

There are mainly two steps as follows.

First, add `MAX_FEE_LIMIT` to dynamicStore and initialize by current value.

Second, create a new proposal which can modify the value of `MAX_FEE_LIMIT` if needed.
