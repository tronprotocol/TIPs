## Simple Summary
This TIP describes feature about `java-tron` stop block synchronization according to specified conditions, such as a given `block height`，`block timestamp`, make the blockchain stop exactly at a specific state.

## Abstract
There are some scenarios that require `java-tron` to be stopped according to given conditions, such as given `block time`, `block height`, used for `database snapshots`, statistics, etc. So we decided to support this feature，three conditions are considered: `block time`,`block height`,`block sync count`.

## Motivation
Currently java-tron does not have a very convenient way to get a specific database state, previously perhaps by manual, or additional scripting, which results in either inaccuracy or high maintenance costs. Therefore a convenient way to achieve this purpose is needed.

## Specification
For  this feature，three conditions are supported，`block time`,`block height`, `block sync count` after node starts , if there has more than one condition , triggered in order of activation.  `persistent database` mentioned below is leveldb or rocksdb.
### 1. Conditions
1. block time, cron expression is support.
   Stop and exit when `blockHeader` in `persistent database` is matched with a given block time.
2. block height, the value must be equal or greater than the blockHeader at startup, if not will be ignored.
   Stop and exit when `blockHeader` in `persistent database` is matched with a given block height.
3. block sync coun, the value must be greater than 0, if not will be ignored.
   Stop and exit when `block sync count` arrive at a given block count since node start.

### 2. How To Set Conditions.
Add three new settings to the config.conf file as follows.
```
net {
  type = mainnet
  # type = testnet
}
... ...
crypto {
  engine = "eckey"
}
node {
   ######### conditionalized stop start
   shutdown {
   # block time
   BlockTime  = "54 59 08 * * ?"  
   # block height
   BlockHeight = 33350800
   # given block sync number after start
   BlockCount = 12
   }
   ######### conditionalized stop start
   
  # trust node for solidity node
  # trustNode = "ip:port"
  trustNode = "127.0.0.1:50051"
  ... ...
```

### 3. Add New Method To Query Persistent DB Directly For  `LatestBlockHeaderNumber`.
add new method `getFromRoot`,  Input & Output  are  same as exist [get ](https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/blob/develop/chainbase/src/main/java/org/tron/core/db2/common/IRevokingDB.java#L18) method
```java
   byte[] getFromRoot(byte[] key) throws ItemNotFoundException;
```

Because of [confirmed block principle](https://tronprotocol.github.io/documentation-en/introduction/dpos/),`TronStoreWithRevoking `is composed of  `snapshotImpl` (in-memory database ) and `snapshotRoot`(persistent DB). The `get `and `put` operations give priority to in-memory snapshotImpl queries, so the current `get` operation cannot directly know the `snapshotRoot` state, such as `LatestBlockHeaderNumber`,and `LatestSolidifiedBlockNum` is not updated in real-time. So it was decided to add a new method to query `snapshotRoot` directly.

### 4. Init Shutdown Condition According To A Given Condition.
init  `stop sync block height`  in  `Manager.class`, update `stop sync block height` when `pushBlock ` if `node.shutdown.BlockTime` if has a priority Trigger,see the implementation for details.

### 5. Check `stop sync block height` And Exit.
Check `stop sync block height` when `processBlock` in `TronNetDelegate.class`,when matched with`LatestBlockHeaderNumber` in `persistent DB`, stop sync and exit,,see the implementation for details.


## Rationale
Get `LatestBlockHeaderNumber` by adding a new method to query `persistent DB` directly, add a new `exit thread`, when `LatestBlockHeaderNumber` in `persistent DB` meets the given condition, the node stops synchronization and exits. Because it is judged to stop before the `pushBlock`, for blocks that have been persisted, the data correctness and integrity have been guaranteed and verified by `two-thirds` SRs.

## Implementation
1.  Add New Method  For Query `persistent DB`.
```java
public class Chainbase implements IRevokingDB {
  @Override
  public byte[] getFromRoot(byte[] key) throws ItemNotFoundException {
    byte[] value = head().getRoot().get(key);
    if (value == null) {
      throw new ItemNotFoundException();
    }
    return value;
  }
}
```

2. Init Shutdown Condition According To A Given Condition.
```java
public class Manager {
    // ... ...
    private BlockingQueue<FilterTriggerCapsule> filterCapsuleQueue;
    @Getter
    private volatile long latestSolidityNumShutDown; //  `stop sync block height` 
    // ... ...
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
    // .. ...
    TransactionRegister.registerActuator();
    //*********************** init `stop sync block height` start 
    long exitHeight = CommonParameter.getInstance().getShutdownBlockHeight();
    long exitCount = CommonParameter.getInstance().getShutdownBlockCount();

    if (exitCount > 0 && (exitHeight < 0 || exitHeight > headNum + exitCount)) {
      CommonParameter.getInstance().setShutdownBlockHeight(headNum + exitCount);
    }

    if (CommonParameter.getInstance().getShutdownBlockHeight() < headNum) {
      logger.info("ShutDownBlockHeight {} is less than headNum {},ignored.",
          CommonParameter.getInstance().getShutdownBlockHeight(), headNum);
      CommonParameter.getInstance().setShutdownBlockHeight(-1);
    }
    // init
    latestSolidityNumShutDown = CommonParameter.getInstance().getShutdownBlockHeight();
    //*********************** init `stop sync block height` end
   }
   
    public synchronized void pushBlock(final BlockCapsule block) {
    // ... ...
    logger.info("Block num: {}, re-push-size: {}, pending-size: {}, "
            + "block-tx-size: {}, verify-tx-size: {}",
        block.getNum(), rePushTransactions.size(), pendingTransactions.size(),
        block.getTransactions().size(), txs.size());
    // *******  update `stop sync block height` when `pushBlock ` if `node.shutdown.BlockTime` if has a priority Trigger
    if (CommonParameter.getInstance().getShutdownBlockTime() != null
        && CommonParameter.getInstance().getShutdownBlockTime()
        .isSatisfiedBy(new Date(block.getTimeStamp()))) {
      latestSolidityNumShutDown = block.getNum();
      CommonParameter.getInstance().setShutdownBlockTime(null);
    }
  // ******* add end *******
  // ... ...
 }
}
        
```

3. Check `stop sync block height` And Exit.
```java
public class TronNetDelegate {
  // ... ...
  private long timeout = 1000;

  private volatile boolean hitDown = false;  // ******* hitDown flag

  private Thread hitThread; // ******   hitThread standalone

  @PostConstruct
  public void init() { // ****** add new Thread for exit.
    hitThread = new Thread(() -> {
      LockSupport.park();
      // to Guarantee Some other thread invokes unpark with the current thread as the target
      if (hitDown) {
        System.exit(0);
      }
    });
    hitThread.setName("hit-thread");
    hitThread.start();
  }

  public void processBlock(BlockCapsule block, boolean isSync) throws P2pException {
   // *********. check and exit
    if (!hitDown && dbManager.getLatestSolidityNumShutDown() > 0
        && dbManager.getLatestSolidityNumShutDown() == dbManager.getDynamicPropertiesStore()
        .getLatestBlockHeaderNumberFromDB()) {
      hitDown = true;
      LockSupport.unpark(hitThread);
      return;
    }
    if (hitDown) {
      return;
    }
    BlockId blockId = block.getBlockId();
// ... ...
}

}
       
```
